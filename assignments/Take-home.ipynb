    "Feel free to look at that paper for guidance (it is one my favorite economics papers ever), but the equations may not be directly applicable as their model is in continuous time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firms enter a discrete number of markets, making profit $\\pi$ in each. If a firm is present in $n$ markets, its flow profits are $n\\pi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firms innovate to enter new markets. They spend $I$ amount on innovation. The output of innovation is\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\lambda = A n^\\alpha I^{1-\\alpha},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "meaning that they can get a new market with probability $\\lambda$. (We assume that $A$ is small enough that $\\lambda<1$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, markets are also \"stolen\" from firms by other competitors. This happens, for **each market**, with probability $\\mu$. (In general equilibrium, there will be a link between $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$, because another firm's success is my failure, but we disregard that link in this problem.) To approximate, we say that the probability of losing exactly 1 market is $n\\mu$ and you can never lose two markets at the same time. "
