# Class 3
## Leftover from Class 2
We cannot select any pair of $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, because their product and sum have to be both real.

Let $\lambda_1 =\lambda_{11}+\lambda_{12}i$ with $\lambda_{ij}$ real. Then
$$
\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 = (\lambda_{11}+\lambda_{21})
+ (\lambda_{12}+\lambda_{22})i.
$$
For this to be real, we need $\lambda_{12}+\lambda_{22}=0$, i.e., the imaginary parts being the same with opposite signs. Similarly,
$$
\lambda_1\lambda_2 = 
(\lambda_{11}\lambda_{21}-\lambda_{12}\lambda_{22})
+
(\lambda_{11}\lambda_{22}+\lambda_{21}\lambda_{12})i
$$
is real if (given what we have established above),
$\lambda_{11}=\lambda_{21}$.

So, we can only have complex pairs of the type
$$
(\lambda_{11}+\lambda_{12}i, \lambda_{11}-\lambda_{12}i),
$$
i.e., complex conjugates.
