= Lecture 15: Scale effects =

== Outline ==
* Today  we look at the "bigger picture" behind the previous models and highlight some of their general features.
* We discuss how innovation is subject to economies of scale and how this leads to "scale effects" whereby bigger countries grow faster.
* We present empirical evidence on these scale effects.

= Ideas and economies of scale =
== Objects and ideas ==
* Romer (1993) classifies goods as
  1. objects
  2. ideas
* Objects are subject to rivalry and costly to replicate (e.g., a book, a car, a microchip).
* Ideas are not subject to rivalry (at least in consumption) and are more easily replicable (e.g., a novel, blueprint of the car, design of the chip).

== Ideas and economies of scale ==
* Consider a production function
\[
Y = F(A,X).
\]
   * $X$ is a vector of traditional inputs (objects)
   * $A$ is an index of the state of technology (ideas)
* Traditional ''replication'' arguments say that $F$ is CRS in objects
\[
F(A,\lambda X)=\lambda F(A,X).
\]
* But then as long as ideas are useful,
\[
F(\lambda A, \lambda X) > \lambda F(A,X)
\]
for $\lambda>1$. 

== Examples ==
=== Cobb--Douglas production function ===
\[
Y = K^{\alpha} (AL)^{1-\alpha}
\]
=== Expanding varieties ===
\[
D = N^{(1-\alpha)/\alpha}L_m.
\]
=== Rising product quality ===
\[
D = QL_m = \lambda^{\int_0^1 N(j)dj} L_m
\]

= The reduced form =
== The reduced form ==
* Both endogenous technology models admit the following reduced form.
* Final good production
\[
Y_t = A_t^\sigma L_{Yt}.
\]
  * CRS in traditional input $L_{Yt}$
  * increasesing in the stock of ideas $A_t$ ($\sigma>0$)
...
* Idea production
\[
\dot A_t = \nu A_t^\phi L_{At}.
\]
  * ideas are ''produced'' using real resources $L_{At}$
  * past ideas may or may not be useful ($\phi$)

== Producing ideas ==
* If $\phi>0$, old ideas help the creation of new ones.
  * "Standing on the shoulders of giants."
...
* If $\phi<0$, new ideas are harder and harder to find.
  * Old ideas crowd out new ones.
  * Think of ideas for a doctoral dissertation.

== Examples ==
* In the expanding variety model without spillovers $\phi=0$:
\[
\dot N = \frac1a {L_N}.
\]
* With knowledge spillovers $\phi=1$:
\[
\dot N = \frac1a NL_N.
\]
* In the rising quality model $\phi=1$:
\[
\dot Q = \frac{\ln\lambda}{a} Q L_{Q}.
\]

== Labor market clearing ==
* Two uses of labor exhaust labor supply,
\[
L_{Yt} + L_{At} = L_t.
\]
* Population grows at rate $n>0$:
\[
L_t = L_0\exp(nt).
\]
  * This is a new assumption but is important if we want to look at long-run growth.

= Balanced growth =
== Balanced growth ==
* We want to characterize balanced growth.
* We assume that a fraction $s$ of the labor force produces ideas, $1-s$ produces goods.
  * Of course, much of our previous classes were about finding the ''equilibrium'' as well as the ''optimal'' $s$.
* ''Per capita'' output growth
\[
\hat y_t = \sigma \hat A_t.
\]
* Idea growth 
\[
\hat A_t = \nu A_t^{\phi-1}L_{At} = \nu s A_t^{\phi-1} L_{t}.
\]

== Case I: $\phi=1$ ==
* If $\phi=1$, idea growth is proportional to population
\[
\hat A_t = \nu s L_t.
\]
* So is output growth
\[
\hat y_t = \sigma\nu s L_t.
\]
* This only leads to constant growth if $L_t$ is constant, $n=0$.
  * In that case, the growth rate is increasing in $s$ and $L$.
* If $n>0$, growth is ''explosive''.

== Case II: $\phi<1$ ==
* Suppose $\hat A$ is constant.
* Then the RHS of the idea equation is constant:
\[
(\phi-1) \hat A + \hat L = 0.
\]
* Idea growth is proportional to population growth
\[
\hat A = \frac{n}{1-\phi}.
\]
* Output growth is proportional to idea growth
\[
\hat y = \frac{\sigma n}{1-\phi}.
\]
* Growth is independent of $s$ and $L$.

= Scale effects =
== Scale effects ==
* How does growth depend on population size?
* ''Strong scale effect'': long-run growth depends on the ''level'' of population,
\[
\hat y = \sigma\nu s L.
\]
* ''Weak scale effect'': long-run growth depends on the ''growth'' of population,
\[
\hat y = \frac{\sigma n}{1-\phi}.
\]

== Scale effects and the role of policy ==
* In these models, policy has an effect on long-run growth if and only if the model also features strong scale effects.
* This is an unfortunate property, because strong scale effects are rejected in the data.

= Evidence on scale effects = 

== Growth in the past 150 years ==
* Population of the U.S.~has grown substantially from 1860.
* The number of people doing R\&D has gone up even more.
* Yet, U.S. growth since 1860 has been very stable at around 2\%.
* With strong scale effects, growth should have exploded.

== ==
\widefigure{stablegrowth}{U.S.~income per capita since 1860}

== Cross-country evidence ==
* Looking across countries, we do not see bigger countries growing faster.
  * This is not by itself evidence against scale effects.
  * Why?

== Openness and country size ==
* Kremer (1993) goes back to 10,000 B.C.~when continents became isolated due to rising sea levels.
* Prior to that, the state of technology was roughly similar across continents.
* By 1500, when continents opened up again,
  1. Eurasia was most populous and richest.
  2. Followed by the Americas.
  3. Many small islands have died out.
...
* Alesina, Spolaore and Wacziarg use post-war data to look at the effect of size ''controlling for the trade openness'' of the country.
  * They find significant positive effect of size (population) on ''income'' for closed economies.
* These are consistent with ''weak'' scale effects.

== Evidence from the very long run == 
* Weak scale effects are also consistent with the income and population boom after the industrial revolution.

== ==
\widefigure{popgrowth}{Income and population since A.D.~1}

== Summing up ==
* In summary, the data reject strong scale effects.
* But there are convincing evidence about weak scale effects.
* Without strong scale effects, can we resurrect the case for policy?

= The best of both worlds = 
== The best of both worlds == 
* We need a model where
  1. there are no strong scale effects,
  2. policy affects growth.
* We mix expanding variety with rising quality.
  * There are two margins on R\&D.
  * Rising quality will help maintain long-run growth.
  * Expanding variety (without knowledge spillovers) will help kill the scale effect.

== Multiple varieties ==
* Consumers value a CES composite of $B_t$ varieties:
\[
C_t = \left[\int_{0}^{B_t} Y_t(i)^\alpha di\right]^{1/\alpha}.
\]
* Each good $i$ is produced using the technology described above:
\[
Y_t(i) = A_t^\sigma L_t(i).
\]
* The total employment for all varieties is $L_m$:
\[
L_{mt} = (1-s)L_t = \int_0^{B_t} L_t(i) di.
\]
* By symmetry across sectors,
\[L_t(i) = (1-s)L_t/B_t\]
and
\[C_t = (1-s)A_t^\sigma B_t^{1/\alpha-1}L_t.\]

== Consumption growth ==
* Per capita consumption is
\[\frac{C_t}{L_t} = (1-s)A_t^\sigma B_t^{1/\alpha-1},\]
which grows at rate
\[\hat c = \sigma \hat A + (1/\alpha-1)\hat B.\]
* There are two sources of growth:
  1. productivity growth
  2. variety growth
* What is the growth of productivity?
* What is the growth of varieties?



== Variety growth == 
* Recall from the expanding variety model (without knowledge spillovers) that
\[
N_{ss} = \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha a\rho}L.
\]
* In the steady state, varieties are proportional to country size $L$.
* As population grows, varieties grow proportionally:
\[
\hat B = \hat L = n.
\]
  * This is a little trickier as our previous derivation assumed no population growth.
  * However, it still holds for constant population growth.
% derive it here

== Productivity growth ==
* Overall, $sL_t$ workers work in R\&D.
* That gives $sL_t/B_t$ R\&D workers for each variety.
* If $\phi=1$, the growth rate of knowledge is proportional to the number of R\&D workers,
\[
\hat A = \frac{\nu s L_t}{B_t}.
\]
* But note that $L_t/B_t$ is constant
\[
\frac{L_t}{B_t} = \frac{\alpha a\rho}{1-\alpha},
\]
so that
\[
\hat A = \frac{\alpha a\rho\nu s}{1-\alpha}.
\]

== Consumption growth ==
* Per capita consumption grows at the rate
\[
\hat c = \frac{\alpha \sigma a\rho\nu s}{1-\alpha} + (1/\alpha-1)n.
\]
* This is not subject to strong scale effects.
* But is subject to weak scale effects,
* and policy affects growth.

  
= Appendix =
== Some growth accounting ==
* Growth in a variable $x$:
\[\dot X \equiv \frac{dX}{dt}
\]
* Growth ''rate'' of $X$:
\[
\hat X \equiv  \frac{d\ln X}{dt} = \frac{\dot X}{X}.
\]

== Some growth accounting ==
* If $Y = X^\alpha Z^\beta$, then
\[
\hat Y = \alpha \hat X + \beta \hat Z.
\]
* If $Y = aX + bZ$, then
\[
\hat Y = s_X \hat X + s_Z \hat Z,
\]
where $s_X=aX/(aX+bZ)$ and $s_Z=1-s_X$.
