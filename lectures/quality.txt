= Lecture 15: Rising product quality =

== Outline ==
* Today we study a model of vertical product innovation where new varieties displace older ones.
* Because profit opportunities are sustained, there will be long-run growth.
* Even though the results look very similar to the previous model, the welfare implications are quite different.

= Vertical product innovation =
== Vertical product innovation ==
* Recall our discussion of various forms of innovation (vertical vs horizontal, product vs process).
* Today we focus on vertical product innovation, where new products provide similar service to old ones but at a better quality.
    * Steamships vs sailships
    * Jets vs turboprops
    * Cellphone vs landline
    * Intel Quad Core 3GHz vs Commodore 64 
* The model applies equally to process innovation, where the cost of production declines.

== Spillovers ==
* There are knowledge spillovers of a different form than before.
* Successful innovators can jump right to the frontier.
    * "Standing on the shoulders of giants."
    * If I develop cars, I don't have to reinvent the wheel.

= Consumers =
== Consumers ==
* Intertemporal preferences:
\[
\mathcal U = \int_{0}^\infty \exp(-\rho t) \ln D(t) dt.
\]
* Per-period utility is Cobb--Douglas of sectors,
\[
\ln D = \int_{0}^1\ln y(j) dj
\]
* Sector $j$ is composed of many perfectly substitutable varieties,
\[
y(j) = \sum_m q_m(j)x_m(j).
\]
    * $q_m$ is the ''quality'' of variety $m$
    * Better products yield more utility.

== Demand ==
* Because utility is Cobb--Douglas across sectors, the expenditure shares are constant:
\[
P(J)Y(j) = E.
\]
    * $P(j)$ is the composite price index of all varieties in sector $j$.
    * $E$ is aggregate expenditure (will be normalized to 1)
* Given the perfect substitution across varieties, only the "best" will be consumed.
    * "Best" means lowest quality-adjusted price, $p_m(j)/q_m(j)$.
    \[
    x_m(j) = \begin{cases}
    Y(j) & \text{if $p_m(j)/q_m(j)=\min$}\\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \]
    
== Demand ==
* Price of sector $j$:
\[P(j)=\min_m p_m(j)/q_m(j).\]
* Demand for sector $j$:
\[Y(j)=E\max_m q_m(j)/p_m(j)\]
* Output of the final good:
\[
\ln D = \ln E + 
\int_0^1 \max_m[\ln q_m(j)-\ln p_m(j)]dj.
\]
* $Q$ is a measure of aggregate quality:
\[
\ln Q \equiv \int_0^1 \ln q_{m^*}(j) dj.
\]

== Consumption smoothing ==
* Again, we normalize $E\equiv1$.
* This leads to a constant interest rate
\[
r= \rho.
\]

= Quality ladders =
== Quality ladders ==
* Within each industry, there are discrete jumps of quality.
    * Quality changes are often major, rather than incremental.
    * We like jumps in continuous time.
* We assume quality can be improved in proportional increments of $\lambda>1$.
    * exogenous
    * constant over time
    * symmetric across sectors
    
== ==
\widefigure{qualityladder}{Quality ladders across sectors}

== Aggregate quality ==
* Recall that aggregate quality is:
\[
\ln Q \equiv \int_0^1 \ln q(j) dj.
\]
* Suppose that sector $j$ is on the $n(j)$th step of the quality ladder:
\[
q(j) = \lambda^{n(j)}.
\]
* Aggregate quality is then
\[
\ln Q = \ln\lambda \int_0^1 n(j) dj.
\]

== Cost of quality ==
* Higher-quality products can be produced at the same marginal cost,
\[
x_m(j) = l_m(j).
\]
* The cost of higher quality is a "fixed cost" (more on this later).
    * Increasing returns to scale in quality.
    * Better design, not better materials.

= Competition =
== Competition ==
* Competition across sectors is uninteresting.
    * Sectors are infinitesimal.
    * Cobb--Douglas demand.
* We focus on competition within sectors.
* Firms compete in (quality-adjusted) prices -- Bertrand.

== Equilibrium ==
* Highest-quality firm captures all the market.
    * It could always undercut a competitor.
* What price does it set?
    * Profit maximization subject to threat of competitors.
    
== Equilibrium ==
* Suppose without competitors, it would set $p^*(j)$, the monopoly price.
* The second-best firm has marginal cost $w$ and would be happy to sell at price $w$.
* But it has a $\lambda$ quality gap.
* Consumers would purchase from second best if
\[
p^* > \lambda w.
\]
* So optimal price is
\[
p_m(j) = \min\{p^*,\lambda w\}.
\]
    * monopoly pricing
    * limit pricing
    
== Pricing ==
* Notice that because of the C--D assumption, $p^*=\infty$.
    * Why?
    * This would be different with CES demand.
* Threat is always binding -- limit pricing:
\[
p_m(j) = \lambda w.
\]
    
= Profits =
== Profits ==
* We have normalized $E\equiv1$.
* Price is $\lambda$ times cost, so profits are $1-1/\lambda \equiv 1-\delta$ fraction of revenues.
\[
\pi = 1-\delta.
\]
* Note that this does not depend on development. 
* If rivals are $n$ steps behind, profits are $1-\delta^n$.

= Innovation = 
== Innovation ==
* As before, innovation takes time, money, and uncertainty.
* R\&D is directed towards a particular sector $j$.
* Successful innovators jump right to the frontier.
    * If current leader has quality $q_m(j)$, then the succesful innovator will have quality $\lambda q_m(j)$.
    * Externality: all firms learn the second-best technology costlessly.
* So that success comes with rate $\iota$, innovators have to employ $a\iota$ workers in R\&D.
    * Again, success is an arrival rate, cost is a flow.

== Dynamic problem ==
* We haven't had a Bellman equation in a while.
...
* What is the value of a leader $n$ steps ahead its rivals?
    * Flow profits are $1-\delta^n$.
    * Succesful innovation brings about capital gain.
    * If a competitor is successful, it takes over the market.
* Denote the aggregate rate of innovation of competitors in sector $j$ by $I$.
* The firm-level state variable is $n$, the aggregates are $w$ and $I$.
    
== Bellman equations ==
=== The Bellman equation of a leader ===
\begin{multline*}
\rho V_l(n,w,I) = \max_{\iota} \{ 1-\delta^n - wa\iota\\
+\iota[V_l(n+1,w,I)-V_l(n,w,I)]\\
+ I[V_f(w,I)-V_l(n,w,I)]
+\dot V_l\}
\end{multline*}

=== The Bellman equation of a follower ===
\[
\rho V_f(w,I) = \max_{\iota} \{ - wa\iota
+\iota[V_l(1,w,I)-V_f(w,I)]
+\dot V_f\}
\]

== Solution ==
* Because anybody can be a follower (they receive the same knowledge spillovers),
\[
V_f = 0.
\]
* The FOC for follower innovation is 
\[
wa \ge V_l(1,w,I),
\]
with equality for positive R\&D.
* Similarly, the FOC for leader innovation is
\[
wa \ge V_l(n+1,w,I)-V_l(n,w,I),
\]
with equality for positive R\&D.
* Again, the individual rate of innovation is not pinned down.

== Solution ==
* Note that $V_l(n,w,I)$ is concave in $n$.
    * Profits are concave.
    * $n$ does not enter anywhere else.
* Hence
\[
V_l(n+1,w,I)-V_l(n,w,I) < V_l(1,w,I) \le w
\]
for all $n\ge1$.
* So the leader never innovates.
    * This implies $n\equiv 1$.
    * What is the key assumption here?
* The leader Bellman has simplified to
\[
\rho V_l(w,I) = 1-\delta 
- IV_l(w,I)+\dot V_l.
\]

= Equilibrium =
== Equilibrium ==
* Equilibrium is characterized by labor and production allocation across sectors, innovation rates in each sector and wages.
* Wages are again a constant fraction of aggregate expenditure,
\[
wL_m = \delta E = \delta.
\]
* We focus on a symmetric equilibrium in which all sectors innovate at rate $I$.
* In this case labor market clearing requires
\[
L_m + aI = L.
\]

== Recipe ==
3. Constant interest rate: $r=\rho$
6. Profits per industry: $\pi = 1-\delta$
5. Wage equation: $w = \delta/L_m$
1. Firm valuation: $\rho v = \pi -Iv+\dot v$
2. Optimal R\&D: $v\le aw $
4. Resource constraint: $L_m+a I = L$

= Balanced growth =
== Balanced growth ==
* Suppose there exists a balanced growth path such that
    1. $I=g$ constant,
    2. $L_m$ is constant.
* Because both $L_m$ and $I$ are constant, so are $w$ and $v$, $\dot v=0$.
* Substitute in the wage equation in the Bellman:
\[
v = \frac{a\delta}{L_m}= \frac{1-\delta}{\rho+g}.
\]
* The resource constraint
\[
L_m +ag = L.
\]
* Solve for $L_m$ and $g$.

== Solution ==
\begin{align*}
L_m &= \delta(L+a\rho)\\
g &= \frac{1-\delta}{a}L-\delta\rho
\end{align*}
* Indeed, as long as $(1-\delta)L/a>\delta\rho$, balanced growth is an equilibrium.
* The growth rate is 
    * increasing in the profit share $(1-\delta)$
    * increasing in country size $L$ 
    * decreasing in the cost of R\&D $a$
    * decreasing in the discount rate $\rho$

== Innovation and growth ==    
* How does innovation map into GDP growth?
* Recall that
\[
\ln D = \ln E + 
\int_0^1 [\ln q_m(j)-\ln p(j)]dj.
\]
* Substitute in $E\equiv1$, $p_m(j)=\lambda w$, and $w=\delta/L_m$:
\[
\ln D = \int_0^1 \ln q(j)dj+\ln L_m = \ln Q+\ln L_m.
\]
* $Q$ is aggregate quality,
\[
\ln Q = \ln\lambda\int_0^1 n(j) dj.
\]

== Innovation and growth ==
* Each $n(j)$ is a Poisson process with arrival rate $I$.
* "Average" $n(j)$ is deterministically growing at rate $I$.
    * Law of large numbers.
* Growth rate of aggregate quality:
\[
\hat Q = I\ln\lambda = g\ln\lambda.
\]
* This is the same as GDP growth.
* GDP growth is proportional to aggregate R\&D.

    
== Discussion ==
* Notice that the reduced form is identical to the expanding variety model.
* The profit share is now $1-\delta$ instead of $1-\alpha$.

= Welfare =
== Welfare ==
* Even if the reduced form is similar, the welfare implications of this model are quite different.
* We look at what the social planner would do.
...
* They would of course solve their Bellman equation.

== The social planner's problem ==
* The aggregate state variables is aggregate quality $Q$, choice variable is $L_m$ (or $I$):
\[
\rho V(Q) = \max_{I} \left\{\ln Q +\ln L_m + \frac{L-L_m}{a}\ln(\lambda) QV'(Q)\right\}
\]
    * flow utility
    * improvement in quality
    * each new step improves quality by $\ln(\lambda) Q$
    
== Solution ==
* Guess that $V(Q) = b_0+b_1\ln Q$.
* The FOC for innovation is
\[
\frac a{L_m} = b_1\ln\lambda.
\]
* Verify that the Bellman holds for $b_1=1/\rho$ and some (ugly) $b_0$.
* The optimal innovation rate is
\[
I^* = \frac La - \frac{\rho}{\ln\lambda}.
\]
* How does this compare to the equilibrium outcome?
\[
I = \frac{1-1/\lambda}{a}L-\frac\rho\lambda?
\]

== Optimal vs equilibrium innovation ==
\[
I^*-I = \frac\rho\lambda
\left(\frac L{a\rho}+1-\frac{\lambda}{\ln\lambda}\right)
\]
* $\lambda/\ln \lambda$ is small for intermediate values for $\lambda$.
* Equilibrium growth is inefficiently 
    1. high for low $\lambda$
    2. low for intermediate $\lambda$
    3. high for high $\lambda$
== ==
\widefigure{lnlambda}{Parameter ranges for efficient innovation}

== Discussion ==
* There are several externalities
    1. profit share vs consumer surplus from higher quality
    2. profit destruction 
    3. knowledge spillovers
* The interaction of all three is a nonlinear function of $\lambda$.
