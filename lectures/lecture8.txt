= Lecture 18: Trade, innovation and growth = 

= Outline =
== Outline ==
* Last time we looked at how specialization changes with growth.
* Today we continue with studying the interaction of countries.
* We ask how globalization affects innovation and growth.
  1. How does trade affect the incentives to do R\&D?
  2. What if knowledge spillovers are global in scope?
  3. What if new products are imitated by low-wage countries?


== Back to expanding variety ==
* We are back to the expanding variety model.
* Previously, we studied a closed economy.
* What would change in an open economy?

== Detour: open economy models ==
We can model open economies in one of three ways:
1. Small open economy
  * Partial equilibrium: world prices are taken as given.
  * Appropriate for small countries.
2. Two countries
  * Appropriate for large countries.
  * Symmetric
  * North--South
3. $N$ countries
  * Best for empirical application,
  * but usually tough to do.

== Recipe ==
3. Constant interest rate: $r=\rho$
6. Symmetric profits: $\pi = (1-\alpha)/N$
5. Wage equation: $w = \alpha/L_m$
1. Firm valuation: $\rho v = \pi + \dot v$
2. Optimal R\&D: $v\le aw/N $
4. Resource constraint: $L_m+a\dot N/N = L$

== Recipe' ==
3. Constant interest rate: $r=\rho$
  * This relied on the choice of numeraire. Now we have two countries, but just one numeraire.
6. Symmetric profits: $\pi = (1-\alpha)/N$
  * Reveneues and profits may change if there are exports.
5. Wage equation: $w = \alpha/L_m$
  * So can wages.
1. Firm valuation: $\rho v = \pi + \dot v$
2. Optimal R\&D: $v\le aw/N $
  * This will change if knowledge spillovers are global in scope.
4. Resource constraint: $L_m+a\dot N/N = L$
  * There is no labor mobility, so this is unchanged.

== Scenarios ==
1. No trade, local knowledge spillovers.
2. No trade, global spillovers.
3. Trade, local spillovers.
4. Trade, global spillovers.
...
(1) has been covered. Here we look at (2) and (4). (3) leads to non-balanced growth.

== Balanced growth ==
* We focus on the balanced growth, when the two countries grow at the same constant rate, $g$.
* The share of expenditure is constant,
\[
 {s}_A = \frac{E_A}{E_A+E_B} = E_A.
\]
   * We normalize global expenditure to 1.
* The share of varieties is constant,
\[
 \xi_A = \frac{N_A}{N_A+N_B}.
\]

== Euler equation ==
* We have two Euler equations for the two representative consumers,
\begin{align*}
 \hat E_A &=r_A-\rho\\
\hat E_B &=r_B-\rho
\end{align*}
* But in balanced growth, $\hat E_A = \hat E_B = \hat E =0$.
* So
\[
 r_A=r_B=\rho.
\]

= No trade, global spillovers =
== No trade, global spillovers ==
* Without trade, revenues, profits and wages are unchanged.
* But beware of different normalization:
\begin{align*}
 \pi_A &= (1-\alpha){s}_A/N_A,\\
 w_A &= \alpha{s}_A/L_{mA}.
\end{align*}
* R\&D costs are $w_A a/(N_A+N_B)$
* These decline at rate $g$.

== Solving for the growth rate ==
* Substitute in the R\&D equation and the wage equation into the Bellman
\[
 (\rho +g) \frac{\alpha a {s}_A}{L_{mA}(N_A+N_B)} = \frac{{s}_A(1-\alpha)}{N_A}.
\]
* Substitute in $\xi_A$:
\[
 \rho +g = \frac{(1-\alpha)L_{mA}}{\alpha a \xi_A }.
\]
* Resource constraint:
\[
 L_{mA} + \frac aN g{N_A} = L_{mA} + a\xi_a g  = L_A .
\]
* Similarly for country $B$.

== Equilibrium growth ==
\[
 g=\frac{1-\alpha}{a}(L_A+L_B)-\alpha\rho
\]
* Same as in the closed economy, but growth now depends on ''world population''.
* Increasing the knowledge stock reduces R\&D costs and leads to higher growth.

== The integrated economy == 
* In a fully integrated economy, ideas, goods and labor flows freely across borders.
* That looks like a closed economy with population size $L_A+L_B$.
* It has the same growth rate as the economy where only ideas are allowed to flow.
* It looks like trade and migration do not matter.
* Let us verify that.

= Trade and global spillovers =

== Expenditures ==
* Because countries are now asymmetric, we have to keep track of prices and expenditures separately.
* Suppose price in country $i$ is $p_i$ for all varieties.
* Then expenditure (share) on its products is
\[
s_i = \frac{N_ip_i^{1-\varepsilon}}{N_Ap_A^{1-\varepsilon} + N_Bp_B^{1-\varepsilon}}.
\]


== Profits and wages ==
* Profits of a firm are proportional to revenue
\[
\pi_i = \frac{(1-\alpha)s_i}{N_i}.
\]
* Similarly, wages are a constant $\alpha$ fraction of revenue,
\[
w_i = \frac{\alpha s_i}{L_{mi}},
\]
where $L_{mi}$ is the number of production workers in country $i$.
 * There is an extra (endogenous) $s_i$ here.
 * However, what matters for dynamics is profits per fixed costs.
 * Both are linear in $s_i$.

== Returns to innovation ==
* The (flow) returns to innovation is
\[
\frac{\pi_i}{v_i} = \frac{\pi_i}{w_ia/N} = \frac{(1-\alpha)L_{mi}}{\alpha a\xi_i}.
\]
* It is independent of $s_i$, so it does not matter whether countries trade.
* In fact, it is the same as in the no trade equilibrium.
* Hence, equilibrium growth is the same at
\[
g=\frac{1-\alpha}{a}(L_A+L_B)-\alpha\rho.
\]

== Why trade does not matter ==
In GE, there always many ways to tell the same story.

== Competition ==
1. Open goods markets increases revenues and hence profits.
2. They also create competition from importers.
3. Under CES, these effects exactly cancel.

== Resource constraint ==
1. A country can only use $L_i$ workers, no matter whether the economy is open or closed.
2. Because under CES, profits are a constant fraction of revenue, a constant fraction of these workers will be producing the profit.
3. Profits from innovation are hence constant.

== Labor demand ==
1. Openness increases revenues.
2. But also bids up wages.
3. With inelastic labor supply, these effects cancel.

= Imitation and growth = 
== Imitation and growth ==
* Ideas spilled over across borders into research, but not into production.
* Now we assume that a technologically backward country (South) imitates products developed by the leader (North).
* Innovation is the only source of long-run growth.
 * Nonetheless, imitation may be welfare enhancing for the South.
 
== Intellectual property rights ==
* In usual discussion about IPRs, it is argued that imitation kills growth.
 1. Imitation reduces the profit of innovators.
 2. Thereby reducing the incentive to innovate.
* IRP protection is a key contended issue at the Doha rounds of the WTO.
* Here we show that imitation may, in fact, spur growth.


= Setup=
== Setup ==
* There are two countries, $N$ and $S$.
* Wages are $w_N$ and $w_S<w_N$.
 * We will have to verify this in equilibrium.
* Free trade in goods, no cross-border knowledge spillovers.
* There are $N$ goods invented.
 * $N_N$ are produced in the North
 * $N_S=N-N_N$ have been copied and are produced in the South.

== Innovation and imitation ==
* Northern firms spend $a/N$ units of labor to come up with a new product.
 * All invented goods contribute to knowledge stock, even imitated ones.
* Until imitated, they enjoy monopoly rents.
 * No competition from Northern firms.
* Southern firms spend $a_m/N_S$ units of labor to copy existing products.
 * Only imitated products contribute to Southern knowledge stock.
* When successful, they take over the market.
 * Innovator's profits fall to zero. (Similarly to obsolescence.)
 * Imitators earn positive profits.

= Static decisions =
 
== Pricing ==
* After a Southern firm has copied the product, it faces competition from the original Northern producer.
* Similarly to the quality ladders model, we have two types of equilibria:
 1. Monopoly pricing. If $w_s/w_N<\alpha$, then the Northern firm cannot compete even with the monopoly price.
 2. Limit pricing. If $w_S/w_N>\alpha$, then the Southern firm engages in limit pricing.
* We focus on the first type of equilibria.
* In that case,
\begin{align*}
 p_N &= \frac{w_N}{\alpha},\\
 p_S &= \frac{w_S}{\alpha}.
\end{align*}

== Expenditures ==
* Again, we have to keep track of prices and expenditures separately.
* Expenditure (share) on products of country $i$ is
\[
s_i = \frac{N_ip_i^{1-\varepsilon}}{N_Np_N^{1-\varepsilon} + N_Sp_S^{1-\varepsilon}}.
\]



== Profits and wages ==
* Profits of a Northern firm are proportional to revenue
\[
\pi_N = \frac{(1-\alpha)s_N}{N_N}.
\]
* Similarly, wages are a constant $\alpha$ fraction of revenue,
\[
w_N = \frac{\alpha s_N}{L_{mN}},
\]
where $L_{mN}$ is the number of production workers in the North.
* Similar conditions hold in the south.
 * There is an extra (endogenous) $s_N$ here.
 * However, what matters for dynamics is profits per fixed costs.
 * Both are linear in $s_N$.

= Dynamic decisions =

== Balanced growth ==
* As ususal, we focus on balanced growth where shares are constant:
\begin{align*}
s_N &= E_N\\
\xi_N &=N_N/(N_N+N_S).
\end{align*}
* Both $N$s grow at rate $g$.

== The problem of a Southern firm ==
Bellman equation:
\[
\rho nv_S = \max_{\lambda}\left\{
\frac{(1-\alpha)s_S}{N_S}  n - \frac {\alpha s_S a_m}{N_SL_{mS}}\lambda+
\lambda v_S
+n\dot v_S
\right\}
\]
* If there is positive imitation,
\[
v_S = \frac {\alpha s_S a_m}{N_SL_{mS}}.
\]
* Denote the fraction of imitated Northern products by
\[
m \equiv \frac{\dot N_S}{N_N} = \frac{g\xi_S}{1-\xi_S}.
\]
* The last equation follows from balanced growth.


== The problem of a Northern firm ==
Bellman equation:
\[
\rho nv_N = \max_{\lambda}\left\{
\frac{(1-\alpha)s_N}{N_N}  n - \frac {\alpha s_N a}{NL_{mN}}\lambda+
\lambda v_N
-m nv_N
+n\dot v_N
\right\}
\]
1. Flow operating profits.
2. Costs of innovation
3. Capital gain from innovation.
4. Capital loss from imitation.
5. Other capital gains.


== Southern recipe ==
3. Constant interest rate: $r_N=\rho$
6. Symmetric profits: $\pi_S = (1-\alpha)s_S/N_S$
5. Wage equation: $w_S = \alpha s_S/L_{mS}$
1. Firm valuation: $(\rho + g) v_S = \pi_S$
2. Optimal R\&D: $v_S\le a_mw_S/N_S $
4. Resource constraint: $L_{mS}+a g = L_S$


== Northern recipe ==
3. Constant interest rate: $r_N=\rho$
6. Symmetric profits: $\pi_N = (1-\alpha)s_N/N_N$
5. Wage equation: $w_N = \alpha s_N/L_{mN}$
1. Firm valuation: $(\rho + g +m) v_N = \pi_N$
2. Optimal R\&D: $v_N\le aw_N/N $
4. Resource constraint: $L_{mN}+a g = L_N$

== Solving for $g$ ==
* From Northern firm valuation,
\[
\rho+g+m = \frac{\pi_N}{v_N} = \frac{(1-\alpha)}{\alpha a \xi_N}L_{mN} = 
\frac{(1-\alpha)}{\alpha a }\frac{g+m}{g}(L_N-ag),
\]
where $\xi_N = g/(g+m)$ follows from balanced growth.
* From Southern firm valuation,
\[
\rho+g = \frac{\pi_S}{v_S} = \frac{(1-\alpha)}{\alpha a_m}L_{mS} = 
\frac{(1-\alpha)}{\alpha a_m}(L_s-a_mg).
\]
* Equilibrium $g$:
\[
g = (1-\alpha)\frac{L_s}{a_m} - \alpha\rho.
\]
== ==

\widefigure{imitation}{Imitation and growth}

== Discussion ==
* Equilibrium growth is determined in the South.
* More imitation (lower $a_m$) leads to faster growth.
* Why?

== Why only Southern variables matter ==
* In profits, wages, as well as imitation costs, only $N_S$ matters.
* The Southern balanced-growth equilibrium is independent of $N_N$.
* Hence in balanced growth, $g$ has to be consistent with the Southern environment.
* If imitation costs depend on $n_N$, this is no longer the case.
* Also if Southern firms engage in limit pricing.

== Why imitation leads to higher growth ==
* Imitation does not steal knowledge stock.
* It only steals produced varieties from innovators...
* and their competitors.
* Competition is proportional to $N_N = \xi_N N$, and is smaller for higher steady-state imitation,
\[
\xi _N = \frac g{g+m}.
\]
* The compeition-reducing effect dominates the loss of capital.
* This would not be the case if knowledge stock also declined with imitation.
