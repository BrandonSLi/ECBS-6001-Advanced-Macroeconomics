= Lecture 14: Dynamic programming: applications =



== Outline ==
* Today we introduce dynamic programming with continuous-time Markov chains.
* If time permits, we apply this framework to the Klette and Kortum (2004, JPE) model of firm-level innovation.
* The model incorporates
    * firm-level innovation
    * endogenous aggregate growth
    * realistic firm demographics (birth, growth, death)
    * endogenous firm size distribution

== Outline ==
* We will stop short of full GE.
* We only study industry equilibrium:
    * There is interaction among firms, entry and exit.
    * But total demand, interest rate and wages are not endogenized.


= DP under uncertainty =

== Moments of a Markov chain ==
* Take a function $v()$ that assigns each state a value, $v_1,...,v_N$.
* What is the expected value of $v$ in a short period of time if we are in state $s_i$ now?
* If $\Delta \approx 0$, the probability of moving from the state is $\approx 0$, so the expected value is $\approx v_i$.
* It is more meaningful to talk about the "rate" of change, as in the case of differential equations.
* What is the ''expected rate of change'' in $v$?
\[
\frac{E(dv)}{dt} = \lim_{\Delta \to0} \frac{E(v_{t+\Delta }|t) - v_t}{\Delta }
\]

== Expectations ==
* Again, start from discrete time:
\[
E[v(t+\Delta)|t] = (1-\sum_{j\neq i}\Delta\lambda_{ij})v_i
+\sum_{j\neq i}\Delta\lambda_{ij}v_j
\]
* Subtract $v_i=v(t)$ from both sides and divide by $\Delta$:
\[
\frac{E[v(t+\Delta)|t] - v(t)}{\Delta } =
\sum_{j\neq i}\lambda_{ij}(v_j-v_i)
\]
* Taking $\Delta \to 0$
\[
\frac{E(dv)}{dt} = \sum_{j\neq i} \lambda_{ij}(v_j-v_i)
\]
* Intuitively, the expected change is a weighted average of all potential changes.
* A change of $v_j-v_i$ arrives with arrival rate $\lambda_{ij}$, so has a weight $\lambda_{ij}$.

== Dynamic programming ==
* We can derive the continuous-time HJB equation with uncertainty as
\[
\rho V(x_i) = \max_{c} \left[ u(x_i,c) + \frac{E dV(x)}{dt}\right]
\]
* The only change is that we have ''expected'' change in $V$ on the RHS.
    1. This holds if $x$ is a jump process.
    2. $x$ is continuous
    3. $x$ is a mix of the two

== Dynamic programming ==
* Suppose our state $x$ follows a Markov chain as above.
* Arrival rates $\lambda_{ij}$ may depend on past states ($i$) and on the policy variable $c$.
* Because $x$ is a jump process,
\[
\frac{EdV(x)}{dt} = \sum_{j\neq i} \lambda_{ij}[V(x_j)-V(x_i)].
\]
* The HJB equation simplifies to
\[
\rho V(x_i) = \max_{c} \left\{ u(x_i,c) + \sum_{j\neq i} \lambda_{j}(x_i,c)[V(x_j)-V(x_i)]\right\}
\]


== Dynamic programming ==
* More generally, suppose $x$ follows a Markov chain, and $y$ is a continuous state variable.
* The HJB equation can be written as
\begin{multline*}
\rho V(x_i,y) = \\
\max_{c} \left\{ u(x_i,y,c) + \sum_{j\neq i} \lambda_{j}(x_i,y,c)[V(x_j,y)-V(x_i,y)]\right.\\
\left.+f(x_i,y,c)V_y(x_i,y)\right\}
\end{multline*}
...
    * This only applies if $y$ does not change when $x$ jumps.
        * $y$ is an aggregate variable, $x$ is individual
    * Otherwise the jump would have to be accounted for.
    * The reverse does not matter. Why?



== Checklist ==
By now you should understand
3. forward Kolmogorov equation
4. stationary distribution
5. Poisson process
6. Poisson distribution
7. moments of a Markov chain
8. Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation with
    * continuous deterministic states
    * jump processes



= Applications =
== Applications ==
* We consider three simple applications
  1. A model of exogenous job loss and job finding.
  2. A model of endogenous job search.
  3. A model of a milk farm.

= Exogenous job search =
== Exogenous job search ==
* There are only two states:
  * $E_1$: worker has a job
  * $E_2$: worker is unemployed
* Transition across states (job loss, job finding) is exogenous (for now).
  * No optimization involved.
  * This is just a simple way of calculating the NPV of a job.

== Exogenous job search ==
* The hazard rate of losing a job is $\delta$.
* The arrival rate of a new job for an unemployed is $\lambda$.

== Exogenous job search ==
* The per-period value of holding a job is $w$.
* The per-period value of being unemployed is $b$.
* What is the overall (present discounted) value of a job?
\[
V_{J} = \int_{t=0}^\infty \exp(-\rho t) u({S_t}).
\]
  * $S_t$ is random and varies over time.
  * We may have to evaluate a complex integral.
  * Dynamic programming makes our lives easier.

== The Bellman equation ==
* The Bellman equation characterizing the value of a job
\[
\rho V_J = w + \delta (V_U-V_J).
\]
* The Bellman equation characterizing the value of unemployment
\[
\rho V_U = b + \lambda (V_J-V_U).
\]
* Note that you can think of the value function as $V(s)$ with $s$ taking only two values.
* This looks much simpler! A system of two linear equations with two unknowns.

== Solution ==
* The solution is
\begin{align*}
V_J &= \frac1\rho \left[
\frac{\rho+\lambda}{\rho+\lambda+\delta}w +
\frac{\delta}{\rho+\lambda+\delta}b
\right]\\
V_U &= \frac1\rho \left[
\frac{\rho+\delta}{\rho+\lambda+\delta}b +
\frac{\lambda}{\rho+\lambda+\delta}w
\right]\end{align*}
* The value of a job is the weighted average of the PDV of wages and the PDV of benefits.
* The weigths depend on all parameters.

== Comparative statics ==
* The value of a job is increasing in
  * wages
  * benefits
  * job finding rate
* Decreasing in
  * discount rate
  * firing rate
* Converges to the PDV of wages $w/\rho$ as
  * $\delta$ goes to zero
  * $\lambda$ goes to infinity




= Endogenous job search =
== Endogenous job search ==
* We now endogenize job search. Everything else remains the same.
* To make sure that jobs arrive at rate $\lambda$, the unemployed has to pay a search cost $g(\lambda)$.
  * $g$ is increasing, convex, twice differentiable, Inada
* Note that $g(\lambda)$ is a flow: the search effort at a given moment in time.
* $\lambda$ is also a flow: the probability of success at a given moment in time.
* This still a memoryless process:
  * past search efforts have no effect
  * (just as time has no effect)

== The Bellman equation ==
* The Bellman is now
\begin{align*}
\rho V_J &= w + \delta(V_U-V_J)\\
\rho V_U &= \max_\lambda \left[ b - g(\lambda) + \lambda(V_J-V_U)\right]
\end{align*}
* Note the maximization in the unemployed state.

== First-order condition ==
* The FOC for $\lambda$ is
\[
g'(\lambda^*)  = V_J-V_U
\]
* The "exogenous" Bellman still correctly calculates $V_J$ and $V_U$ once we substitute in the new benefits $b-g(\lambda^*)$ and the job finding rate $\lambda^*$.
* Find a $\lambda^*$ that satisfies both the FOC and the Bellman.

== Solution ==
* Subtracting the two Bellman equations:
\[
V_J-V_U = \frac{w-b+g(\lambda^*)}{\rho+\delta+\lambda^*}
\]
* Substitute this into FOC to get an implicit solution for $\lambda^*$:
\[
g'(\lambda^*) = \frac{w-b+g(\lambda^*)}{\rho+\delta+\lambda^*}
\]

== Comparative statics ==
* Totally differentiating the implicit function...
* search intensity $\lambda^*$ is
  * increasing in $w-b$
  * decreasing in $\rho+\delta$
  * decreasing with an upward shift of search costs

== A milk farm ==
* Our last application considers a milk farm with $n$ cows.
* The only state variable is $n$.
* The control variable is the feed $c$ we give to each cow.


== Flow profits ==
* Each cow gives $m(c)$ milk per period of time.
  * $m$ is increasing and concave.
* Flow profits are
\[
\pi = [pm(c) - wc]n,
\]
where
  * $p$ is the price of milk
  * $w$ is the price of feed

== Dynamics ==
* New cows are born at rate $\lambda$ to each existing cow (not modeled).
* Cows die at rate $\delta(c)$.
  * $\delta$ is decreasing and convex
* What is the dynamics of $n$?
* Over a $\Delta $ period of time, $n$ becomes
  * $n+1$ with probability $\lambda n \Delta $
  * $n-1$ with probability $\delta(c) n \Delta $
  * $n$ with probability $1-[\lambda+\delta(c)]\Delta $

== Valuing the farm ==
* What is the value of the farm?
* The Bellman equation
\begin{multline*}
\rho V(n) = \max_c\{
[pm(c) - wc]n +\\
\lambda n[V(n+1)-V(n)] +\\
\delta(c)n [V(n-1)-V(n)]
\}
\end{multline*}


== Solution ==
* Guess that $V(n) = vn$.
\[
\rho vn = \max_c\{
[pm(c) - wc]n +
\lambda n [v] +
\delta(c) n [-v]
\}
\]
or
\[
\rho v = \max_c \left\{pm(c) - wc + [\lambda-\delta(c)]v\right\}
\]
* FOC for $c$
\[
p m'(c) - w -v\delta'(c) = 0
\]
* Find $c$ and $v$ so that both are satisfied.



= A firm-level model of innovation =


== Firm demographics vs size distribution ==
* In a Markovian world, these are intricatelly linked.
* Remember that
\[
 \dot \pi(t) = \pi(t) \Lambda
\]
characterizes the dynamics of the ''probabilities'' of each state.
* When there are "many firms," they also correspond to the ''fraction'' of firms being in each state.


= Stylized facts =
== Stylized facts ==
* The model is consistent with a range of facts about
    1. firm-level innovation
    2. firm dynamics
    3. firm size distribution

== Stylized facts ==
1. R\&D intensity is independent of firm size.
2. The size distribution of firms is highly skewed.
3. Smaller (younger) firms are more likely to exit. Survivors grow faster.
4. Among larger firms, growth is unrelated to size (Gibrat's law).
5. Small (young) firms are more volatile.
6. The market share of a cohort declines as it ages.

= Setup =
== Environment ==
* There is a large number of firms.
* Each firm has a number of products, each product is only produced by one firm.
* Overall, there is a large number of products.


== Environment ==
* There is a continuum of firms.
* Each firm has a countable number of products, each product is only produced by one firm.
* Overall, there is a continuum of products.

==  ==
\widefigure{qualityladder}{Products of different quality}


== Aside: Cardinality of the continuum ==
* The ''cardinality'' of a set is a measure of the "number of elements" in it.
    * $|A|=|B|$ if there is a bijection between the elements of $A$ and $B$.
    * $|A|>|B|$ if $|a|=|B|$ for a proper subset $a\subset A$, but not $|A|=|B|$.
* ''Continuum'' is the cardinality of the real line.
    * $|\mathbb R|=|[0,1]| = |\mathbb R^2|$
    * $|\mathbb R|>|\mathbb N|$
* The cardinality of the continuum is ''infinite''. What does this mean?

== Notes ==

== Why continuum? ==
* We need an infinite number of firms to invoke the LOLN -- we want to rule out aggregate uncertainty.
* Any fraction of firms can be characterized by a real numbers -- just like a probability.
* For practical purposes, we can simply think of the continuum case as $N\to\infty$.

== Basic setup ==
* Firms invest in R\&D to develop better versions of products (vertical product innovation).
* These products are "stolen" from other firms.
* Entrants also innovate.


== Novelties ==
* Firms are modelled as a collection of product lines, $n=0,1,2,3,...$.
* Innovation technology is convex -- we can pin down innovation for each firm.



= Decisions of the firm =

== Firm profits ==
* Each product brings a total profit of $\pi$. This could be motivated by
    * fixed aggregate spending
    * fixed aggregate number of products
    * constant markup
* Products are symmetric.

== Decisions of the firm ==
* Each firm is characterized by the number of products it has, $n=0,1,2,3,...$.
    * $n=0$ is a dead firm
* Total flow profits are $n\pi$.
* Once we know per-product profits, the only decision is about changing $n$.
* The firm invests in R\&D to increase $n$.

== Firm dynamics ==
* After successful R\&D, $n$ increases by 1.
* If a product is stolen by a rival, $n$ decreases by 1.
* Each product is stolen with arrival rate $\mu$ (to be endogenized later).

== Inputs of innovation ==
* Innovation takes a flow R\&D expenditure $R$
    * researchers
    * materials
    * Econometrica subscription
* and stock of firm-specific knowledge
    * previous patents
    * previous ideas
    * previous papers
...
* The knowledge stock is assumed proportional to $n$.

== Output of innovation ==
* The output of innovation is a new product.
* As usual, the success of innovation is random.
* A new product arrives with Poisson arrival rate $I$.

== The innovation production function ==
\[
 I = G(R,n)
\]
* standard neoclassical production function
* increasing and concave in $R$
...
    * Optimal $R$ can be determined for each firm.
...
* increasing in $n$
...
    * Bigger firms are better at R\&D -- they do more.
...
* linear homogenous in $R$ and $n$
...
    * Bigger firms do proportionally more R\&D.

== Intensive form ==
Because of CRS,
\[
 I = G(R,n) = nG(R/n,1) \equiv ng(R/n),
\]
or written as a cost function
\[
 R/n = g^{-1}(I/n) \equiv c(I/n).
\]
...
$c$ is
    * increasing
    * convex

== The Bellman equation ==
We are now ready for the Bellman equation:
\begin{multline*}
 r V(n) = \max_{I} \left\{ n\pi - nc(I/n)\right.\\
+ I[V(n+1)-V(n)]\\
+ \left.\mu n[V(n-1)-V(n)]\right\}
\end{multline*}
...
    * The opportunity cost of time is traded off against
    * operating profits minus R\&D expenditures
    * capital gains from developing a new product
    * capital losses from losing any of the $n$ products

== Teamwork ==
1. Guess and verify that $V(n)=vn$.
2. Solve for $v$ and optimal innovation $I$.
3. How does R\&D expenditure depend on size?


== Solution ==
* Guess that the value function is
\[
 V(n) = vn.
\]
* In that case,
\[
 rvn = \max_I \{\pi n-nc(I/n) + Iv - \mu n v\}.
\]
* The FOC:
\[
 c'(I/n) = v.
\]
* Denoting $I/N\equiv \lambda$, and dividing by $n$,
\[
 rv = \pi - c(\lambda) + \lambda v - \mu v
\]

== Solution ==
* $v$ and $\lambda$ jointly solve
\[
 c'(\lambda) = v
\]
and
\[
 v = \frac{\pi-c(\lambda)}{r+\mu-\lambda}.
\]
* R\&D intensity, $R/n = c(\lambda)$ is independent of firm size.

== Solution ==





= Firm dynamics =
== Firm dynamics ==
* Firm dynamics is characterized by a Markov chain over $n=0,1,2,3.,..$.
* Exit ($n=0$) is an ''absorbing state''.
* Forecast the size of a firm born with $n=1$.
...
    * This is a birth-and-death process, but with different rates than in the problem set.

== The Kolmogorov equation ==
\[
 \dot \pi_0(t) = \mu \pi_1(t)
\]
\[
 \dot \pi_n(t) = \lambda (n-1)\pi_{n-1}(t) - (\lambda+\mu)n \pi_n(t) + \mu (n+1)\pi_{n+1}(t)
\]
Boundary condition:
\[
\pi_1(0) = 1
\]

== Solution ==
* This system of differential equations has the solution
\begin{align*}
\pi_0(t) &= \frac\mu\lambda \gamma(t)\\
\pi_1(t) &= [1-\pi_0(t)][1-\gamma(t)]\\
\vdots\\
\pi_n(t) &= \pi_{n-1}(t)\gamma(t),\\
\end{align*}
where
\[
\gamma(t) = \frac{\lambda - \lambda e^{-(\mu-\lambda)t}}{\mu - \lambda e^{-(\mu-\lambda)t}}.
\]
* Conditional on survival ($n>0$), this is a geometric distribution with parameter $\gamma(t)$.

== Firm demographics ==
=== Hazard of exit ===
\[
\frac{\dot \pi_0(t)}{1-\pi_0(t)} = \mu - \lambda \pi_0(t)
\]
decreasing in $t$ -- consistent with younger firms exiting more often.


== Firm demographics ==
=== Unconditional expected growth ===
\[
\frac{E dn(t)}{n(t)}\equiv \lim_{\Delta\to0}\frac{En(t+\Delta)-n(t)}{n(t)\cdot \Delta } = \lambda-\mu
\]
is independent of firm size and age.
...
 * This includes the possibility of exit, $n(t+\Delta)=0$.
 * For large, mature firms, whose exit is unlikely, this is consistent with data.



== Firm demographics ==
=== Volatility ===
\[
\frac{\text{Var} dn(t)}{n(t)}\equiv \lim_{\Delta\to0}\frac{E[n(t+\Delta)-n(t)]^2}{n(t)\cdot \Delta } = \frac{\lambda-\mu}{n}
\]
is decreasing in firm size




= Industry equilibrium =
== Industry equilibrium ==
* We want to endogenize $\mu$, the rate at which products are stolen.
* Part of $\mu$ is driven by innovation by \emph{all} the incumbents.
    * When Google comes up with Android phones, they will steal the market from Apple's iPhone.
* Each time an incumbent is successful in innovation, the new product is selected randomly from the product space $[0,1]$.
    * undirected innovation

== Industry equilibrium ==
* The hazard of your product being stolen by an incumbent is
    \[
    \Lambda = \int_0^1\lambda(j)dj = \int_0^1\lambda dj = \lambda.
    \]
* There are also new entrants, who develop better versions of the existing products.
* Suppose this happens at rate $\eta$. Then
\[
\mu = \lambda+\eta.
\]


== Entry ==
* There are infinite number of firms wishing to enter.
* If they spend $F\eta$ on R\&D, they can improve on a randomly chose product with arrival rate $\eta$.
* Their Bellman equation:
\[
\rho \cdot 0 = \max_{\eta}\left\{-F\eta + \eta[V(1)-0]\right\}
\]
...
    * Anybody can be an entrant, so they should derive no value from it.
    * Success brings about an increase in value (incumbents enjoy rents).

== Solution ==
* The FOC:
\[
 F = v,
\]
which implies $F=c'(\lambda)$.
* Because new entrants technology is linear, $\eta$ is not determined by this FOC.
...
* Recall the incumbents' optimum:
\[
v  = F = \frac{\pi-c(\lambda)}{r+\mu-\lambda} = \frac{\pi-c[c'{}^{-1}(F)]}{r+\eta}
\]
* This pins down $\eta$.
    * If entry is slower, incumbents enjoy larger profits, $v$ is higher than $F$.

== Solution ==
* This completes the characterization of industry equilibrium.
* We can do simple comparative statics.
    * What happens if $F$ increases?



= The firm-size distribution =
== The firm-size distribution ==
* Denote the mass of firms with $n$ products at time $t$ by $M_n(t)$.
* How can we characterize $M_1(t), M_2(t),...$?
* Is there a steady-state distribution, $M_1, M_2,...$?
...
* These questions sound similar to Markov chain forecasting.
* Indeed we will be using the same tools.


== Incumbents ==
* The evolution of incumbents is characterized by the Markov chain.
* Because there are a continuum of firms, and shocks are independent across firms, the ''fraction'' of firms moving from state $n$ to $k$ is identical to the ''probability'' of moving from $n$ to $k$.
* We can use the Kolmogorov equation to characterize the ''flows'' between firms of different sizes.
\[
\dot M_n(t) = -(\lambda+\mu)n M_n(t) + \lambda(n-1)M_{n-1}(t)+ \mu(n+1)M_{n+1}(t)
\]

== Entrants ==
* The flow of entrants adds to the stock of size-1 firms:
\[
\dot M_1(t) =-(\lambda+\mu) M_1(t) + 2\mu M_{2}(t) + \eta
\]

== Solving for the steady-state distribution ==
* In steady state, $\dot M_n=0$.
\begin{align*}
0 &=-(\lambda+\mu) M_1 + 2\mu M_{2} + \eta
0 &= -(\lambda+\mu)n M_n + \lambda(n-1)M_{n-1}+ \mu(n+1)M_{n+1}
\end{align*}
* This can be solved to yield
\[
M_n = \frac{\lambda^{n-1}\eta}{n\mu^n}.
\]

== The firm-size distribution ==
* The firm-size distribution is
\[
\frac{M_n}{\sum_{i=1}^\infty M_i} = \frac{(1+\theta)^{-n}}{n\ln(1+1/\theta)},
\]
where $\theta=\eta/\lambda$.
* This is the logarithmic distribution, which is very skewed.
    * In line with the stylized facts.
