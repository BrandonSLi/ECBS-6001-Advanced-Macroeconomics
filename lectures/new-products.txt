= Lecture 18: A model of new products =
 
== Outline ==
* Today we apply continuous-time dynamic programming to a model of endogenous growth.
* We will use
  * dynamic programming with a jump process 
  * differential equations
  * steady-state properties
* The application is also heavy in general equilibrium. 
  * aggregation of individual decisions
  * resource constraints 
  * endogenous prices

== Outline ==
* Today we will study a model where growth occurs through an increase in the number of products.
* Product innovation is a source of technical progress.
  * Most of income differences across countries are due to differences in productivity.
* We will make use of the Dixit--Stiglitz model of monopolistic competition.

== Innovation ==
* Innovation is a conscious economic activity.
  * In contrast to exogenous technical progress.
  * Responds to profit incentives of innovators.
* Process innovation reduces production costs of existing products. Product innovation entails coming up with new products.
  * We focus on product innovation.
* Horizontal innovation leads to products with new functions. Vertical innovation serves similar function at higher quality. 
* Innovation ("idea") may or may not be replicable.
  * We begin with a setup with fully private benefits.
  * Then discuss the case of knowledge spillovers.

== Product innovation ==
* Firms spend on R&D to come up with blueprints of products.
* Only products for which blueprints exist can be produced.
* The holder of a blueprint obtains a monopoly over producing that product.
  * Patent protection
  * Any small cost of imitation prevents it in equilibrium.
  * Later we will study imitation more generally.
* Firms do two things:
  1. develop blueprints
  2. produce from existing blueprints

= Static equilibrium =

== Structure of the economy ==
* Firms produce goods based on existing blueprints.
 * using labor
* They also employ researchers to develop new blueprints
  * same type of labor
  * demand for funds
* Because of IPR protection, firms make profits.
* Workers earn wages and hold a portfolio of all firms (stock market).
* They decide how much to consume and how much to save.
  * supply of funds

== Static equilibrium ==
* We begin by characterizing the equilibrium at a given point in time.
  * production of existing products
* We then move on to dynamic decisions
  * development of new products

== Consumers ==
* Consumers value all existing products symmetrically.
 * No obsolescence.
* Suppose $N(t)$ products exist at time $t$.
* Composite consumption good:
\[
D = \left[ 
  \sum_{i=1}^{N(t)} x_i^\alpha
\right]^{1/\alpha} \,\,\, 0<\alpha<1
\]
* This is a constant-elasticity-of-substitution utility function a la Dixit and Stiglitz.
* Elasticity of substitution is $\varepsilon = 1/(1−\alpha)>1$.
  * What does $\varepsilon > 1$ mean?

== Love of variety ==
* Suppose each variety costs $p_i = p$.
* Total spending on $n$ goods: $Npx = E$, so that $x = E/(pN)$.
* What utility does the consumer achieve?
\[
D = 
\left[ 
  \sum_{i=1}^N x^\alpha
\right]^{1/\alpha}
 = 
\frac Ep
\left[ 
  \sum_{i=1}^N N^{-\alpha}
\right]^{1/\alpha}
= \frac Ep N^{(1-\alpha)/\alpha}
􏰙\]
* For given income $E$ and prices p, utility increases in N.
* Because $x_i$s are imperfect substitutes of one another, it is
better to have a little of each than much of one.
* Consumption of non-existent varieties is 0. The convexity of
preferences dislikes zeros.
* This is the love-of-variety feature of preferences.

== Love of variety ==
* Alternatively, we can express love of variety in the expenditure function.
* The minimum cost of obtaining one unit of utility,
\[
P = \left[
  \sum_{i=1}^N p^{1-\varepsilon}
\right] ^{1/(1-\varepsilon)}
 = p N^{1/(1-\varepsilon)}
\]
is decreasing in $N$.
* We can think of the price of non-existent varieties as $\infty$.
* When the product becomes available, its price falls from $\infty$ to
$p$.
* An increase in $N$ then reduces the aggregate price index.
* Hence indirect utility,
\[
u = \frac EP = \frac Ep N^{(1−\alpha)/\alpha}
\]
is increasing in $N$.

== Firms ==
* Each product is produced with labor only: $x_i = l_i$.
* The unitary labor requirement is not restrictive. Why? 
* The demand for product $i$:
\[
x_i = E \frac
  {p_i^{-\varepsilon}}
  {\sum_{j=1}^N p_j^{1-\varepsilon}}
\]

== Market structure ==
* Each firm has a monopoly over its blueprint.
* There are many firms so that each firm takes aggregate prices and quantities as given.
* Monopolistic competition.
* Demand for product i is isoelastic with elasticity ε:
\[
x_i = E \frac
  {p_i^{-\varepsilon}}
  {\sum_{j=1}^N p_j^{1-\varepsilon}}
  = A p_i^{-\varepsilon}
\]
 * The firm takes $A$ as given but maximizes over $p_i$.
* Markup pricing
\[
p_i = \frac {\varepsilon}{\varepsilon - 1} w
= \frac w\alpha
\]

== Choice of numeraire ==
* We normalize aggregate expenditure to $E \equiv 1$.
* This is a weird choice of numeraire but will prove convenient later.
  * We are free to fix any one price in each time period to whatever value we want.
  * The price need not be 1, need not even be constant. 
  * So we pick $P = 1/D$ so that $E = P D = 1$.

== Firm profits ==
* A fraction α of revenue goes to labor, (1 − α) goes to profits. πi =(1−α)pixi
* In symmetric equilibrium, each firm sells 1/N. πi = 1−α.
N
* Note that 􏰌ow profits tend to zero as N increases without bound.
* Will R&D be sustained in the long run?

== Determining wages ==
* The wagebill of the firm is
wli = α .
 N * Aggregating across all N firms,
wLm = α,
where Lm is the amount of labor in production.
* So wages are
w=α. Lm

== Checklist ==
So far we have determined
* how consumers value variety
* how firms price their products
* what is the total labor demand in production

= Dynamic decisions =

= Supply of funds =

== Consumption smoothing ==
* Consumer has log utility 􏰕∞
U =
exp(−ρt)lnD(t)dt.
t=0
* Can save and borrow at interest rate r:
a ̇ = ra + y − c. * The corresponding Bellman:
ρV (a, y, r) = max {ln c + Va(a, y, r)(ra + y − c)} c

== Deriving the Euler equation ==
* The FOC for optimal c:
1 = Va(a,y,r).
c
* Taking logs and differentiating wrt time −cˆ= Vaa(ra+y−c)
Va
(xˆ denotes x ̇/x)
* Differentiating through the Bellman to express Va:
ρVa =Vaa·[ra+y−c]+Va ·r
* Substituting in Vaa:
cˆ = r − ρ

== Nominal vs real interest rate? ==
* All this referred to an economy in which there is no in􏰌ation. * If there is in􏰌ation,
a ̇ = ra + y − pc.
* And the FOC becomes
1 = pVa(a,y,r,p). c

== Exercise ==
* Derive the Euler equation in this economy.
* What is the optimal rate of growth for consumption? * What do you need to know about p(t)?

== The Euler equation ==
* The Euler equation
Dˆ = r − Pˆ − ρ.
* Dˆ+Pˆisthegrowthrateofexpenditure,E=PD.
* But expenditure is constant, E ≡ 1.
* The interest rate equals the discount rate
r = ρ.
* This completely characterizes the supply side of financial markets.

= Demand for funds =

== The decision to innovate ==
* Take a firm with n products.
* n is a firm-level state variable.
* The firm takes aggregates, N and Lm as given. * The firm can raise capital at rate r = ρ.
* We next analyze the R&D decision.

== Research and development ==
* R&D is costly and random.
* Successes arrive with a Poisson process.
* The arrival rate depends on R&D expenditure.
* So that a new product arrives with rate λ, the firm has to hire aλ workers.
* Again, λ is an instantaneous arrival rate.
* R&D expenditure aλ is a 􏰌ow.
* Past expenditure and past success do not matter.
* Let us write down the Bellman equation for the value of the firm.

== The value of a firm ==
 * The Bellman equation
ρV (n, N, Lm) = max n − aλ
􏰑1−α α λ N Lm
  +λ[V(n+1,N,Lm)−V(n,N,Lm)]
+ EdV(n,N,Lm)}
dt
* The state variables are n, N and Lm. Only n is affected by the firm.
* The opportunity ("financing") cost of the firm equals
* 􏰌ow profits:
* operative profits
* minus the cost of R&D
* capital gains:
* the invention of a new product
* change in the value of existing products

== Solution ==
* Guessthatthevalueislinearinn,V(n,N,Lm)=nv(N,Lm).
􏰑1−αα 􏰒 ρnv(N, Lm) = max n − aλ + λv(N, Lm) + nv ̇
  * TheFOCforλis with equality if λ > 0.
Lm
λ N Lm αa ≥v(N,Lm),
 * Simplify to
* This links N, Lm, and v.
ρv(N, Lm) = 1 − α + v ̇. N

== Innovation and growth ==
* Note that the FOC did not pin down λ.
* This because of the linearity of both the benefit and the cost
of innovation.
* Would change with convex costs of innovation.
* Suppose firm i innovates with rate λi, using aλi R&D workers. * This leads to a new product with arrival rate λi.

== Aggregate innovation ==
* The arrival rate of the first new product across all firms is 􏰔 λi ≡ Λ.
i
* The overall number of R&D workers is 􏰔 aλi = aΛ.
i
* Even if λi is indeterminate, aggregate innovation Λ will be
pinned down in equilibrium.
* Because new products arrive with Λ, the growth rate of N is
EdN/dt = Λ. NN

== Dynamic equilibrium ==
* We now characterize the dynamic equilibrium.
* The key is to pin down the allocation of labor to its two uses:
1. production: Lm 2. R&D: aΛ
* Resource constraint for labor
Lm + aΛ = L,
 * or
N ̇ = L − L m . a
 * Note that whenever N ̇ > 0, Lm = αa/v, so that
N ̇ = L − α . av

== Long-run growth ==
* We first show that there is no long-run growth in this economy.
* This is because the incentive to innovate disappears as N
grows large.
* Suppose
N > N ̄ ≡ (1 − α)L αaρ
and there is no R&D.
* Then both N and Lm are constant, so is v(N,Lm).
* From the Bellman equation,
v(N,L)= 1−α. ρN
* But because N > N ̄, this is indeed smaller than the cost of innovation αa/L.
* So no innovation is a unique equilibrium.

== Steady state ==
* The * * * *
steady-state N (and hence steady-state productivity) is increasing in country size L
increasing in profit share (1 − α) decreasing in R&D cost a decreasing in discount rate ρ
D (1−α)/α 􏰗 (1 − α)L 􏰘(1−α)/α
L=N →αaρ m

== Phase diagram ==

== Recipe ==
3. Constant interest rate: $r=\rho$
6. Symmetric profits: $\pi = (1-\alpha)/N$
5. Wage equation: $w = \alpha/L_m$
1. Firm valuation: $\rho v = \pi + \dot v$
2. Optimal R\&D: $v\le aw $
4. Resource constraint: $L_m+a\dot N = L$


== Dynamic equilibrium ==
* We now characterize the dynamic equilibrium.
* The key is to pin down the allocation of labor to its two uses: 
    1. production: $L_m$
    2. R\&D: $a\Lambda$
* Resource constraint for labor
\[
L_m + a\Lambda  = L,
\]
* or
\[
\dot N = \frac{L-L_m}{a}.
\]
* Note that whenever $\dot N>0$, $L_m = \alpha a/v$, so that
\[
\dot N = \frac{L}{a} - \frac{\alpha}{v}.
\]

== Long-run growth ==
* We first show that there is no long-run growth in this economy.
* This is because the incentive to innovate disappears as $N$ grows large.
* Suppose 
\[
N>\Bar N\equiv \frac{(1-\alpha)L}{\alpha a \rho}
\]
and there is no R\&D.
* Then both $N$ and $L_m$ are constant, so is $v(N,L_m)$.
* From the Bellman equation,
\[
v(N,L) = \frac{1-\alpha}{\rho N}.
\]
* But because $N>\Bar N$, this is indeed smaller than the cost of innovation $\alpha a/L$.
* So no innovation is a unique equilibrium.

== Characterizing the dynamics ==
We collapse the six equations of the "recipe" into two.
=== Labor market clearing + wage equation + optimal R\&D ===
\[
\dot N = \max\left\{0, \frac La - \frac\alpha v\right\}
\]
=== Bellman equation ===
\[
\dot v = \rho v - \frac{1-\alpha}{N}
\]

== Steady state ==
* The steady state is such that both $\dot N$ and $\dot v$ are zero.
* Steady-state $N$ is
\[
N_{ss} = \frac{(1-\alpha)L}{\alpha\rho a}.
\]
* Steady-state productivity (output per worker) is
\[
\frac{D}{L_m} = N^{(1-\alpha)/\alpha} \to \left(\frac{(1-\alpha)L}{\alpha a \rho}\right)^{(1-\alpha)/\alpha}.
\]
    * (This only includes manufacturing, not R\&D.)
* Both are
 * increasing in country size $L$
 * increasing in profit share $(1-\alpha)$
 * decreasing in R\&D cost $a$
 * decreasing in discount rate $\rho$



= Knowledge spillovers = 
== Knowledge spillovers ==
* Now suppose that R\&D has external benefits to other researchers.
* In particular, let the cost of R\&D decrease with the number of existing products, $N$, $a/N$.
* This changes
    1. the incentive to innovate
    2. the resource requirements of innovation
    
== The new Bellman ==
* The new Bellman equation:
\[
\rho nv(N,L_m) = \max_{\lambda}\left\{
\frac{1-\alpha}{N}  n - \frac {\alpha a}{NL_m}\lambda+
\lambda v(N,L_m)
+n\dot v
\right\}
\]
* First-order condition
\[
\frac {\alpha a}{NL_m} = v
\]
* The rate of return on innovation
\[
r_{R\&D} = \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}\frac{L_m}{a} - \hat N - \hat L_m.
\]
    * Profits per fixed cost are now independent of $N$.
    * There are capital losses because innovation becomes ever cheaper.

== The new resource constraint ==
If aggregate innovation is $\Lambda$, it takes up $\Lambda a/N$ workers.
\[
L_m + \Lambda \frac aN = L
\]

== Balanced growth ==
* Suppose that this economy attains a balanced growth path with constant growth rate $g=\hat N$.
* "Balanced" means that labor allocations ($L_m$) are constant.
* We then verify that this is an equilibrium.
...
* From the Bellman equation for firm value
\[
\rho = \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}\frac{L_m}{a} - g.
\]
* From the resource constraint,
\[
L_m + ag  = L.
\]

== Solution ==
\begin{align*}
L_m &= \alpha(L+a\rho)\\
g &= \frac{1-\alpha}{a}L-\alpha\rho
\end{align*}
* Indeed, as long as $(1-\alpha)L/a>\alpha\rho$, balanced growth is an equilibrium.
* The growth rate is 
    * increasing in the profit share $(1-\alpha)$
    * increasing in country size $L$ (more on this later)
    * decreasing in the cost of R\&D $a$
    * decreasing in the discount rate $\rho$

= Other ways to generate growth =
== Other ways to generate growth ==
* Knowledge spillovers reduce the cost of innovation so that profit ''per cost'' do not vanish.
* We have other ways to generate growth:
    * In a different demand system / competition, profits may not vanish. (See quality competition later.)
    * If innovation costs are in the final good rather than in labor units, they "mechanically" get lower with development:
    \[
    P = N^{(\alpha-1)/\alpha}.
    \]
    * (This is also an external benefit of R\&D but it is ''pecuniary''.)
    * If population grows, firms keep doing R\&D. This may even lead to growth in output ''per capita''. (See later.)
    

= Policy and welfare = 
== Policies ==
* We want to see if policy has an effect on growth.
* We consider two policies:
    1. an R\&D subsidy
    2. a production subsidy
    
== R\&D subsidy ==
* The government pays a fraction $\phi$ of research expenses.
* This is financed by a lump-sum tax.
* This changes the incentive to innovate,
\[
\frac {\alpha a(1-\phi)}{NL_m} = v,
\]
* and the Bellman equation
\[
\rho = \frac {(1-\alpha)L_m}{\alpha a(1-\phi)} - g.
\]
== Solution ==
\begin{align*}
L_m &= \alpha[L+a(1-\phi)\rho] < L_m(\text{no subsidy})\\
g &= \frac{1-\alpha}{a(1-\phi)}L-\alpha\rho > g(\text{no subsidy})
\end{align*}
* An R\&D subsisdy increases growth and decreases manufacturing employment/output.

== Production subsidy ==
* Manufacturers receive an ad valorem subsidy of $\phi_x$.
* Their aggregate revenue is hence $1+\phi_x$,
* profit per variety is \[(1+\phi_x)(1-\alpha)/N.\]
* This seems to raise the profitability of R\&D.

== Production subsidy ==
* But note that the wage equation changes as well,
\[
w = (1+\phi_x)\alpha/L_m.
\]
* So the ''returns'' to R\&D are unchanged:
\[
\frac{(1+\phi_x)(1-\alpha)L_m}{(1+\phi_x)a\alpha N}.
\]
* Production subsidy raises prices and wages proportionally, so does not lead to any reallocation.


== Welfare ==
* Is the equilibrium growth rate $g$ ''optimal''?
* We see that R\&D subsidies can increase the growth rate -- should they be employed?
...
* We answer that by solving the benevolent social planners problem.
* The social planner maximizes discounted utility subject to technology contraints.
    * (Prices and markets do not matter.)
* We begin with the case without knowledge spillovers.


== Static optimum ==
* First note that the static equilibrium is optimal -- despite imperfect competition.
* Given $L_m$ workers and $N$ existing varieties, the social planner would like to allocate $L_m/N$ workers to each -- just as in equilibrium.
* Because markups are symmetric, they do not involve any distrotion -- relative prices across firms are unchanged.

== Dynamic optimum ==
* Aggregate output of the final good is
\[
D = N^{(1-\alpha)/\alpha}L_m.
\]
* Per-period utility is 
\[
\ln D = \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}\ln N+\ln L_m.
\]
* The one state variable is $N$. 
* Choice variable is $L_m$, or, equivalently, aggregate innovation $\Lambda$.

== Bellman equation ==
* The Bellman equation of the policy maker
\begin{multline*}
\rho V(N) = \max_{L_m}\left\{
\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}\ln N+\ln L_m  \right. \\
\left.+\frac{L-L_m}{a}\left[V(N+1)-V(N)\right]\right\}
\end{multline*}
...
* We make the approximation 
\[
V(N+1) - V(N) \approx V'(N)
\]
so that we can use the envelope theorem. (Works for large $N$.)

== Solution ==
* The first-order condition for $L_m$ is
\[
\frac 1{L_m} = \frac{V'(N)}{a}.
\]
* Using the envelope theorem to determine $V'$,
\[
\rho V'(N) = \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha N} + \dot N V'{}'(N).
\]
* Now introduce $v\equiv \alpha V'(N)$. The two equations can be rewritten as
\begin{align*}
L_m &= \frac {a\alpha}{v}\\
\rho v &= \frac{1-\alpha}{N} + \dot v
\end{align*}

== Solution ==
* Substituting in the resource constraint,
\[
\dot N = \frac La - \frac \alpha v.
\]
* And the Bellman equation
\[
\dot v = \rho v - \frac{1-\alpha}{N}.
\]
...
* But notice that these are the same as the equilibrium conditions.
* The equilibrium is hence efficient.


== The case with knowledge spillovers ==
* The social planner's Bellman now
\begin{multline*}
\rho V(N) = \max_{L_m}\left\{
\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}\ln N+\ln L_m  \right. \\
\left.+\frac{(L-L_m)N}{a}V'(N)\right\}
\end{multline*}
...
* Guess that the value function is of the form
\[
V(N) = b_0 + b_1 \ln N.
\]

== Solution ==
* Guess that the value function is of the form
\[
V(N) = b_0 + b_1 \ln N.
\]
* Then $V'(N) = b_1/N$ and
\[
L_m = \frac{a}{V'(N)N} = \frac{a}{b_1}
\]
is constant.
* So is the growth rate
\[
\frac{\dot N}{N} = \frac{L-L_m}{a} = \frac La - b_1.
\]
* Verify that the Bellman equation holds for
\[
b_1 = \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha \rho}
\]
and some (ugly) $b_0$.

== Optimal growth ==
* Substituting in $b_1$, optimal growth is
\[
g^* = \frac La - \frac{\alpha\rho}{1-\alpha}.
\]
* Notice that
\[
g^* = \frac g{1-\alpha}>g.
\]
* Equilibrium growth is ''inefficiently low''.
* What is the intuition?

== Discussion ==
* We have endogenized ''technology'': companies invest in new technology just as they invested in physical capital in the Solow/Ramsey model.
* But it has proven difficult to endogenize ''growth'': R\&D can also be subject to decreasing returns to scale.
* We had to assume spillovers: the social returns to R\&D are higher than the private returns.
* This model is not necessarily about ''endogenous growth'', but certainly about ''endogenous innovation'' and technology.
* Innovation (and potentially growth) responds to taste and policy parameters and, notably, ''country size''.
* Equilibrium growth is lower that optimal, there is room for policy.

= Appendix =
== CES review ==
* Take the following CES utility function:
\[
u(x_1,x_2) = \left[x_1^\alpha+x_2^\alpha\right]^{1/\alpha},
\]
and define $\varepsilon=1/(1-\alpha)$, $\alpha=1-1/\varepsilon$
* Maximize utility subject to prices $p_1$ and $p_2$:
\[
p_1x_1+p_2x_2 = E
\]
* What is the relative demand for $x_1$ and $x_2$?

== Utility maximization ==
* The marginal rate of substitution
    \[
    \frac{u_1}{u_2} = \frac{x_1^{\alpha-1}}{x_2^{\alpha-1}} = \left(\frac{x_1}{x_2}\right)^{-1/\varepsilon}
    \]
* In the optimum, this equals the relative price, $p_1/p_2$:
\[
\frac{x_1}{x_2} = \left(\frac{p_1}{p_2}\right)^{-\varepsilon}
\]
* The relative demand is loglinear in relative prices.
    * The elasticity of substitution is constant at $\varepsilon$.

== Cost minimization ==
* In parallel, we can solve the cost minimization problem.
* Minimize $E = p_1x_2+p_2x_2$ subject to $u(x_1,x_2)=u_0$.
    * FOC:
    \[
    p_i = \lambda x_i^{\alpha-1}
    \]
\[
E = u_0\left[p_1^{1-\varepsilon}+p_2^{1-\varepsilon}\right]^{1/(1-\varepsilon)}
\]
* The term
\[
P \equiv \left[p_1^{1-\varepsilon}+p_2^{1-\varepsilon}\right]^{1/(1-\varepsilon)}
\]
is the ''ideal price index''.


== Markup pricing ==
* Take a demand function $D(p)$ and a cost function $C(Q)$.
* Maximize profit
\[
pD(p) - C[D(p)]
\]
* First-order condition
\[
D(p) + pD'(p) - C'[D(p)]D'(p) = 0
\]
* Divide by $pD'$ and rearrange
\[
\frac{p-C'[D(p)]}{p} = \frac{D(p)}{-pD'(p)} \equiv \frac 1\varepsilon.
\]
* Price--cost markup
\[
\frac{p}{C'[D(p)]} = \frac{\varepsilon}{\varepsilon-1}.
\]
